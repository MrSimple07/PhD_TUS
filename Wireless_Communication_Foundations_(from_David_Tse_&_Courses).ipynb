        "- **Channel**: Path that the signal takes from transmitter to receiver. Includes effects like noise, fading, interference.\n",
        "- **Modulation**: Mapping bits to waveforms (e.g., QAM, PSK).\n",
        "- **Multiple Access**: How users share spectrum. (TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA).\n",
        "- **MIMO**: Using multiple antennas to increase throughput/reliability.\n",

        "### 1.2. Channel Types\n",
        "- **AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise)**: Simplest, just noise.\n",
        "- **Rayleigh Fading**: No line-of-sight (multipath fading).\n",
        "- **Rician Fading**: Some line-of-sight + multipath.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3. Capacity & Tradeoffs\n",
        "- **Shannon Capacity**: Max bits/sec you can send over a noisy channel.\n",
        "- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Higher SNR â†’ higher capacity.\n",
